	<h1>Time, Spacea and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm. It quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, and it helps us understand how the algorithm's performance scales with input size. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, making them preferable for large datasets.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity is another crucial aspect of algorithm analysis. It assesses the amount of memory space required by an algorithm as a function of the input size. In this context, we often use notation like O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> helps us optimize memory usage and prevent resource exhaustion.</p>
